                Hello and welcome! My name is Luke Tyson, I am a fullstack
                developer (but you already knew that from the nav bar), and this
                is my portfolio website! I appreciate your taking the time to
                visit and look at my work, so thank you!
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my coding journey in 2023 through General Assembly's
                12-week Software Engineering Immersive, and through their
                program I acquired a skill-base centered around fullstack
                web-development, utilizing technologies including but not
                limited to HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, Express, and
                React.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before becoming a developer, I had accrued over ten years of
                professional experience in customer-oriented roles, working with
                various teams to provide excellent service to my community. I've
                loved the opportunities I've had to meet and work with clients
                and peers from all different backgrounds, and I look forward
                meeting to the many more people that I have yet to collaborate
                with!
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides being a coder, I am also an avid reader, a prolific
                musician, a butter-fingered climber of rocks, a Dungeons and
                Dragons enjoyer, an amateur weightlifter, an ex-chimney sweep, a
                local hero of slam poetry, and a lifelong folder of all things
                laundry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please use the nav bar above to check out my resume and my
                portfolio projects. If you are a recruiter, employer, or fellow
                programmer (or if you've got some laundry for me to fold) please
                feel free to reach out to me through the contact information on
                the left.
